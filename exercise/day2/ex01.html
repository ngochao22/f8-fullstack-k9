            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>

            <p>
                This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about cooking technique
                called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you
                submerde the food(usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a wter
                bath thar is aprecisele set to the target temperature you want
                the food to be cooked to.In his book,<i>Cooking fir Geeks,</i>
                Jeff Potter is as "ultra-low temperature poaching".
            </p>
